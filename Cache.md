# Cache in Webdev

## Webdev

In web development, cache refers to a temporary storage area where website data is stored for quick access by a user's web browser. The purpose of caching is to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the internet and speed up the loading time of a website. When a user visits a website, the browser stores a copy of certain elements, such as images and HTML files, in the cache. Then, if the user visits the same website again, the browser can load the page faster by using the cached data instead of downloading it again from the server. This makes the website load faster and saves bandwidth.

## PHP

In PHP, caching refers to the process of storing the output of a PHP script in a cache so that it can be reused in the future, instead of re-executing the script and generating the output every time it's requested. This can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of a website, especially if the script is computationally intensive or requires a long time to execute. There are different ways to cache the output of PHP scripts, including using server-side caching mechanisms such as memcached or APC, or by storing the output in a file. The choice of caching mechanism depends on the specific needs of the application and the server environment.

## Memcached

Memcached is a free and open-source, high-performance, in-memory key-value data store. It is often used as a caching mechanism in web applications to speed up dynamic web pages by caching the results of database queries, API calls, or other expensive computations.

In a web application, Memcached operates as an intermediate layer between the application and the database. When a request is made, Memcached checks to see if it has the data stored in memory. If it does, it returns the data from memory, which is much faster than fetching the data from the database. If the data is not in the cache, the application queries the database, stores the result in the cache, and returns the result to the user.

By using Memcached, web applications can reduce the load on the database and improve the performance and responsiveness of the application. The cache can be easily scaled by adding more Memcached servers to handle larger amounts of data and higher traffic.


## Varnish

Varnish is an open-source, high-performance HTTP accelerator designed for caching dynamic web content. It is often used as a reverse proxy server that sits between a web server and the internet, serving cached content to users and offloading the load from the web server.

Varnish operates by caching the output of web pages in memory and serving cached content to users instead of fetching it from the web server every time it's requested. This greatly speeds up the delivery of content to users and reduces the load on the web server.

Varnish is highly configurable and can be customized to fit the specific needs of a web application. It can be used to cache pages with different TTL (time-to-live) values, based on the type of content, and it supports various caching policies and can be used to cache pages generated by dynamic applications, such as those built with PHP or Ruby on Rails.

Overall, Varnish can significantly improve the performance and scalability of a web application and is a popular choice for high-traffic websites and web applications.

Varnish works with PHP by serving cached content from its in-memory cache, instead of fetching it from the PHP application each time a request is made. When a user requests a page from a PHP-powered website, Varnish checks to see if the content is stored in its cache. If it is, Varnish serves the content directly to the user, without sending the request to the PHP application. This greatly reduces the load on the PHP application and speeds up the delivery of content to the user.

If the content is not in the cache, Varnish sends the request to the PHP application. The PHP application generates the content and sends it back to Varnish, which caches the content in memory. The next time a user requests the same content, Varnish serves the content directly from the cache, without sending a request to the PHP application.

Varnish can be configured to cache content for a specific time period, known as the TTL (time-to-live), after which the content will be evicted from the cache and the PHP application will be queried for the content again. The TTL can be set on a per-page basis, allowing for different caching behavior for different types of content.

By using Varnish as a reverse proxy in front of a PHP application, web administrators can greatly improve the performance and scalability of their website, especially for high-traffic websites.


## Drupal

Drupal 9 uses a caching system to improve the performance of its website. The caching system works by storing the output of expensive operations, such as database queries or complex computations, in memory for quick access, instead of re-executing the operation each time the same data is needed.

Drupal 9 uses a variety of caching mechanisms, including page caching, block caching, and entity caching. Page caching stores the full HTML output of a page in the cache, so it can be served directly to the user without being regenerated by the application. Block caching caches the output of individual blocks, such as a menu or a list of articles, so that they can be reused across multiple pages. Entity caching caches the data for individual entities, such as nodes or taxonomy terms, so that they can be loaded quickly when needed.

In addition to its built-in caching mechanisms, Drupal 9 also provides APIs for custom caching, so that site builders and developers can cache custom data structures and algorithms as needed.

The caching behavior in Drupal 9 can be configured in the site's performance settings, and administrators can control the length of time that cached data is stored, as well as the maximum size of the cache. By carefully tuning these settings, administrators can balance the performance benefits of caching with the freshness of the content, to provide an optimal user experience.
