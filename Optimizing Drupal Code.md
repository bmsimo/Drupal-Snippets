# Optimizing Drupal Code

1. Loading all the nodes at once instead of loading them one by one.
2. Move the load of multiple nodes into a single statement instead of loading one node at a time in the loop.
3. Use the getValue method to retrieve all the values at once instead of calling it multiple times.
4. Use the `array_map` function to clean the HTML content of all the fields in one go instead of using a loop.
5. Use the `json_decode` method's second argument to parse the data directly into an associative array, instead of converting it to an object and then back to an array.
6. Consider using the `array_reduce` function instead of iterating over the data and pushing items into separate arrays, to reduce the number of array operations.
