# Drupal Documentation

> This is a personal project of mine, i'm storing all the knowledge i've been acquiring over the years in this repository. I'm trying to make it as easy as possible for anyone to understand and use it. I'm trying to break down the documentation into different sections that may have subsections too.

- I've kept the files in this repo, but the main project has been moved to Gitbook. You can find it [here](https://drupal.bermaki.com/).
